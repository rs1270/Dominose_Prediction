Domino's Inventory Optimization and Sales Forecasting
Objective:
Develop a predictive model to forecast sales, enabling optimal ingredient purchasing to minimize waste and prevent stockouts.

Key Business Use Cases:

Inventory Management: Maintain stock levels aligned with predicted demand.
Cost Reduction: Minimize waste and costs from overstocking or expired inventory.
Sales Forecasting: Anticipate sales trends to refine strategies and promotions.
Supply Chain Optimization: Align ordering processes with predicted sales to prevent disruptions.
Approach:

Data Preprocessing and Exploration:

Clean missing/inconsistent data and handle outliers.
Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and seasonal patterns.
Sales Prediction:

Engineer features (e.g., day of the week, holidays, promotions).
Select and train a time series model (e.g., SARIMA, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
Evaluate model performance using MAPE.
Purchase Order Generation:

Predict sales for the next week.
Calculate ingredient requirements based on forecasted sales.
Generate a detailed purchase order.
Results:

Accurate weekly sales predictions.
Optimized purchase orders ensuring balanced stock levels.
